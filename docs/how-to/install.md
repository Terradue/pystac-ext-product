# Install and build

## Install the library

The package declares Python 3.10 or later and PySTAC `>=1,<2`. The test matrix covers Python 3.10–3.14.

```bash
python -m pip install pystac-ext-product
python -c "from pystac.extensions.product import ProductExtension; print(ProductExtension.get_schema_uri())"
```

## Install from a checkout

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Terradue/pystac-ext-product.git
cd pystac-ext-product
python -m pip install -e .
```

If an existing editable installation predates a packaging change, repeat the editable install in that environment.

## Preview the documentation

Install the documentation tools in your development environment:

```bash
python -m pip install "mkdocs<2" mkdocs-material "mkdocstrings[python]"
mkdocs serve
```

Build with warnings treated as errors:

```bash
mkdocs build --strict
```

## Run repository checks

With Hatch installed, run these commands from the checkout:

```bash
hatch run dev:check
hatch run dev:typecheck
hatch run dev:security
hatch run test:test
```
